1. Open Image

2. Process(change color channel ordering)

3. Canny edge detection

	You can see the change in the results by changing the two thresholds.

4. Morphological image processing(dilate, erode, open, close)

5. Extracting straight lines(Hough Transform, Probability Hough Transform)

6. Extraction circle(Hough Circle Transformation)

7. Extract connected domain(Flood Fill)

8. Detect matching points of interest(Harris corners)
